### Project Description
You will create a Bootstrap 3 or 4 site about yourself.

It should be a professional profile website including:
	-Education
	-Interests (related to jobs)
	-Work experience
	-Contact information
	-One extra section of your choosing
	-You are required to go beyond the default bootstrap layout, and either create your own theme, or use any 3rd party theme online to stylize your page.
	-Your site should be compatible and be automatically “responsive” (i.e., adapt) to the following display widths: mobile phone (<=320px), tablet (>768px), and desktops (>=960px).

You will be evaluated on:
	1. Visual design and aesthetics - Is the site visually appealing?
	2. Usability - Is the site easy to navigate and find things?
	3. Content - Does it have all the information I want to know about you?
	4. Use of a non-default Bootstrap theme
	5. Responsiveness on different devices (mobile phone, tablet, and desktop computer)
	6. Commits to Github and deployment on Heroku
